# Create-Swiftstart

Automate the setup of Vite-React & Next.js projects with a pre-designed boilerplate structure using create-swiftstart. This tool saves your time and provides a clean starting point for your React or Next.js applications.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize a New Project

```bash
npm init swiftstart@latest
```

This command initializes a new project using the latest version of create-swiftstart and displays a prompt to set up a Vite-React/Next.js project with a custom boilerplate.

### 2. Create a New React Project

```bash
npm init swiftstart@latest myapp -t react
```

Create a new React application named `myapp` using create-swiftstart. The `-t` flag specifies the template (in this case, "react").

### 3. Create a New Next.js Project

```bash
npm init swiftstart@latest myapp -t next
```

Create a new Next.js application named `myapp` using create-swiftstart. The `-t` flag specifies the template (in this case, "next").

## Templates

- **React**: Set up a Vite-powered seo-friendly React project with a predefined folder structure.
- **Next.js**: Initialize a Next.js project with a custom boilerplate for rapid development.
